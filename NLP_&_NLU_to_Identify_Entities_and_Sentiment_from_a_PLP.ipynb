        "#What is NLP?\n",
        "**NLP** focuses on understanding natural language in terms of patterns detected from a large proportion of unstructured data (AKA *entities*). To do that, NLP breaks and processes language  using a particular strategy called “**Tokenization**”, which aims to normalize a text by either breaking down patterns to their stem (e.g “carry”/”carries” → “carri”) or to an always recognizable pattern (e.g “carry”/”carries” → “carry”). Such granular techniques are called **Stemming** and **Lemmatization**.\n",

NLU enables computer programmes to deduce purpose from language, even if the written or spoken language is flawed. In fact the model is designed to complete sentiment analysis tasks and determine the emotional tone of a text.\n",
